      designation: Certified Massage Therapist
      content: >-
        I’m a certified massage therapist, which means that I have had to pass
        both a theoretical exam (anatomy, physiology, sports injuries,
        pathology, ergonomics and rehabilitation) and a practical exam. I was
        certified in 2019 in Sweden and have been working since then.


        The education gave me important knowledge about muscles and the body as
        a whole, but much of the secret to both treatment and relaxation is
        presence and curiosity. Every body is unique and should be treated as
        such.
